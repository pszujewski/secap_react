# React client for capstone project

[View the deployed project](http://secap-pszujewski.surge.sh/)

#### Background

I completed a software development course on EDX in 2018. For my capstone project, I was given two example datasets and the spec (EBNF) for a query language that would fetch data from them.

I was asked to 1) parse the datasets (given as CSV and XML files) into a convenient data structure, 2) write the data structures to disk and 3) permit queries to be executed against those data structures.

The code for that project was written in TypeScript using a TDD process. [Click here to view the repo and code.](https://github.com/SECapstone/secap_pszujewski)

This repo contains the code for a React-based frontend that interacts with the TypeScript REST API [available here](https://boiling-meadow-87470.herokuapp.com/)
